This project was motivated by the curiosity of my friends and I to find out the minimum wage level of regencies or cities on the island of Java to decide where to look for a job later..
What I have done:
- Collected minimum wage data for each province from various sources, ranging from official government websites to governor's decrees.
- Aggregated and cleaned all the data collected using Excel. And matched the data to the shapefile of the Java island regencies/cities. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/alfaradi/portfolio/blob/main/UMK_Pulau_Jawa_Excel-Tableau/UMK_Pulau_Jawa_Dataset.xlsx"> Excel File. </a>
- Creating an interactive dashboard using Tableau to make it easier to understand the data and gain insights.
